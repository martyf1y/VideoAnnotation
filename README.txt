This application allows you to simple make text annotations to HQ videos. It is more of a concept than a fully functioning tool so there may be a few bugs. The code uses an addon called ofxAVFVideoPlayer but has been modified to include certain functions. 

It includes things like autosaving every minute and slowing down the speed of video. 

How it works: 

- The program will find the files in the movies folder and allow you to select one.
- Make sure to choose a video.
- If there is a txt file with the same name it will ask if you want to load already made annotations.
- Press TAB to create  annotation. Press again to END it.
- It should type most characters except the ones above the numbers.
- Mouse click with the annotation selected to place it. Mouse click to SELECT it, while selected it follows the mouse and will record that movement for the video playback.
- It will stay in its position until you END it or the video runs out.
- ENTER pauses video. You can still create annotations while paused.
- UP DOWN ARROWS move the video back or forth 10 frames.
- Mouse click on the time bar to skip to a certain part.
- Only 1000 annotations can be made.
- You cannot delete an annotation once it has been made.
- Press ESC to exit, you will be asked if you want to save the annotations as a txt file. If there was a txt file already there it will override it.

- If you find any problems or have improved it in some way please send me a message with the code to mjmartin.work@gmail.com.
